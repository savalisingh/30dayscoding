Scope:
Scope is area where variables, function , classes are accessible .

Types 
1.Global:
-Variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope.
-Global variables are accessible from anywhere in your code, both inside and outside functions or blocks.
-It's essential to use global variables judiciously because they can lead to naming conflicts and make it challenging to track variable usage and modifications.
2.Local:
-Variables declared inside a function or block have local scope.
-Local variables are accessible only within the function or block where they are defined.
-These variables are typically temporary and are often used to store intermediate results or values needed only within a specific context.
